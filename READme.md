**Proposal:** ....

## Current Tasks
- Update READMe into proper ReadMe
- Re-implement wordle into New York Times format (5 letter words 6 attempt is classic)

- Change method of accessing words from load file to using python library
- Implement word option categories such as countries, foods, random and etc
- Make possible to add own category (drop .txt file)
- Make wordle and hangman into GUI

## To Debug
- 'play again' should reset wordle correct, misplaced, incorrect, etc...
- create exception for longest words
